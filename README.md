🧭 problem-clarifier — Orientation Protocol
What this is

This repository contains a strict problem-clarification protocol designed to act as an entry gate for serious decision work.

Its sole purpose is to transform a vague, confused, or poorly articulated input into:

a clearly rephrased problem

the single most critical missing element

one actionable central question

one clear direction toward the appropriate next conversation

This protocol does not solve anything.
It determines what kind of work should happen next — or whether work should happen at all.

What this protocol does

When applied to an input, the protocol performs one single pass and produces:

1. Simple Rephrasing
One clear sentence restating the problem without extrapolation.

2. Main Missing Element Identified
One critical missing element (objective, constraint, or context).

3. Central Question
One simple, actionable question that captures the real issue.

4. Recommended Direction
One — and only one — recommended next conversation:

🥇 Decision Analyst

🥈 Executive Synthesis Engine

🥉 Executive Writer

🛡️ Critical Decision Review

No alternatives.
No branching.

What this protocol explicitly does NOT do

This is non-negotiable.

The protocol does not:

solve the problem

make decisions

perform analysis

explore options

ask clarification questions

adapt deeply to context

iterate or refine outputs

If the input is vague, incomplete, or confused, the protocol works only with what is provided.

This limitation is intentional.

Design constraints (intentional limitations)

This public version is intentionally incomplete.

It:

performs one single pass

asks zero follow-up questions

provides one direction only

prioritizes speed and discipline over precision

It demonstrates the orientation logic, not full decision-grade execution.

When to use this

Use this protocol when:

the problem is unclear

the request is confused or poorly framed

you are unsure what kind of work is actually required

premature analysis or writing would be wasteful

Do not use this when:

a real decision must already be made

trade-offs need to be analyzed

risks must be assessed

accountability is required

In those cases, this protocol should act only as a gate, not a solution.

Output format (immutable)

Every output must follow exactly this structure:

Simple Rephrasing

Main Missing Element Identified

Central Question

Recommended Direction

The output must end with:

“To go further, use the specialized conversation recommended above.”

No additional commentary is allowed.

Why this exists

Most failed decisions are not caused by poor analysis.
They are caused by:

solving the wrong problem

analyzing before a real decision exists

writing before intent is clear

skipping orientation under time pressure

This protocol exists to stop that failure mode early.

Escalation

This repository covers clarification only.

If a real, high-stakes, accountable decision exists, escalation to a decision-grade framework is required.

The complete system — including:

decision formulation

adversarial analysis

stress-testing

executive synthesis

Final note

This protocol is intentionally strict.
It refuses comfort, exploration, and premature execution.

If that feels limiting, this tool is not for you.
If that feels relieving, you are using it correctly.
